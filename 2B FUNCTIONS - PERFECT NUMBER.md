# Exp.No:2(b) FUNCTIONS-MODULO VALUE.

# AIM
To write a Python program to define a function that accepts 2 values and return its modulo value

# ALGORITHM
Start

Read integer a from the user

Read integer b from the user

Compute the remainder: c = a % b

Print the result as "modulo is", c

End

# PROGRAM
```
def result (a,b):
    c= a%b
    print ("modulo is",c)

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
```
