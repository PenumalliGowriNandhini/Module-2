# Exp.No:2(c) BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS- z*56

# AIM
To write a python program using lambda function which takes z as a parameter and returns z*56 using python.

# ALGORITHM
Start

Read integer z from the user

Define a lambda function: product = lambda z: z * 56

Call the product function with input z

Print the result

End

# PROGRAM
```
z=int(input())
product=lambda z:z*56
print(product(z))
```

# RESULT
Thus the python program using lambda function which takes z as a parameter and returns z*56 using python has been implemented and executed successfully.
